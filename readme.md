# Design System - A Sketch template

A .sketch template for design systems working for Sketch 3.6 with the [CSSketch](https://github.com/JohnCoates/CSSketch) plugin.

Inspired by a [workflow shared by Julien Pecorino](https://blog.trailapp.com/sketch-css-in-search-of-the-perfect-ui-workflow-8be56b24c984#.ym8am8z4b?ref=sketchhunt).

## Usage

This template is created for Sketch 3.6. As of February 2017, the CSSketch plugin does not work with later versions of Sketch.
